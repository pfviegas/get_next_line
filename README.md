# get_next_line
## Reading a line from a fd is way too tedious

The get_next_line project is about developing a function that reads a file line by line in C language. 

The function must read the next line from a file descriptor and should handle reading and returning each line in subsequent calls, manage multiple file descriptors, and correctly handle newline characters and end-of-file conditions. 

The project helps students understand file I/O operations, memory management, and the handling of file descriptors in the context of C programming.
